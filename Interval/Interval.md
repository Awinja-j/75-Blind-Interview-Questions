# Merge Intervals

The Merge Intervals pattern is an efficient technique to deal with overlapping intervals. In a lot of problems involving intervals, you either need to find overlapping intervals or merge intervals if they overlap. The pattern works like this:


Given two intervals (‘a’ and ‘b’), there will be six different ways the two intervals can relate to each other:

Understanding and recognizing these six cases will help you help you solve a wide range of problems from inserting intervals to optimizing interval merges.


How do you identify when to use the Merge Intervals pattern?

If you’re asked to produce a list with only mutually exclusive intervals
If you hear the term “overlapping intervals”.

Merge interval problem patterns:

Intervals Intersection (medium)
