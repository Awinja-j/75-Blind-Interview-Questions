### Backtracking Algorithms:

Backtracking is an algorithmic technique where the goal is to get all solutions to a problem using the brute force approach. It consists of building a set of all the solutions incrementally. Since a problem would have constraints, the solutions that fail to satisfy them will be removed.

`It uses recursive calling to find a solution set by building a solution step by step, increasing levels with time.`

*Backtracking is not considered an optimized technique to solve a problem. It finds its application when the solution needed for a problem is not time-bounded.*
