## Trie

A Trie in computer science is a tree structure that allows you to do things such as very quick lookup of words within the english language. Typically if you were to write a word processor that did spell checks against words in a document, you would implement a trie and perform a very quick lookup to check whether or not the words in your word document are indeed valid words.
